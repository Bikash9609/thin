This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

# Font Linking

- Create `react-native.config.js`
- Paste this content

```js
module.exports = {
  dependencies: {
    'react-native-vector-icons': {
      platforms: {
        ios: null,
      },
    },
  },
  project: {
    ios: {},
    android: {},
  },
  assets: ['./assets/fonts/'],
};
```

- Create `assets/fonts` in the main directory (not inside src) and copy the font files(.ttf) directly inside it
- Next run `npx react-native-asset`

# For Building

the short answer uses `gradlew assembleRelease` instead.

not short answer :) The command you are using `gradlew bundleRelease` builds an android App bundle. read this: Difference between apk (.apk) and app bundle (.aab) and this: https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle AAB file is new and not all stores support it.

## Generating APK

- Debug

  - `npx react-native run-android --variant=debug`
  - output: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

- Release APK (Generate this to install in android, even for testing)
  - `npx react-native run-android --variant=release` or `cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease`
  - **DONE** Follow: https://stackoverflow.com/a/46170797/12255214 or https://reactnative.dev/docs/signed-apk-android

## Generate AAB

- `cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease && ./gradlew bundleRelease`
- `npx react-native build-android --mode=release`

## Testing Release Build

- `yarn android --mode release`
